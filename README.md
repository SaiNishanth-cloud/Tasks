# Tasks
# Kubernetes Cluster Task

Created a terraform file to depoly kubernetes cluster on google cloud.


# Network Task 

I used JMeter to generate network traffic to a webserver that responds to HTTP requests.
Then, I installed a Python package called tcpdump2csv which allows me to convert tcpdump output to a CSV file format.
Finally, I wrote a Python script to analyze the network traffic data from the CSV file.
